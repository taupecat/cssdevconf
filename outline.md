• three things in webdev I love:
    • wordpress
    • responsive web design
    • Sass

this talk is about the second two things

but everything here can be applied to wordpress! (or drupal, or Sitecore, or Static site generators) it doesn't matter the back end platform as long as you can use sass in your front end authoring process. 

## how can sass help in RWD development

• variables

• functions
    • percentage() + create your own

• media query bubbling with @content
    • downside: repeating media queries (gzip)

• breakpoints

• @extend

• flint?

• sass-enabled grid system

## suggested sass structure

• util directory

## what sass *isn't* good for

• vendor prefixing

## research
